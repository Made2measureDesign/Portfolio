Babington is a country house with bedrooms, a spa,
gym and a membersâ€™ club in the heart of Somerset. A
countryside retreat for eating, drinking and relaxing.
The house of mainly Georgian architecture has been
designated by English Heritage as a Grade II listed building.

have now been made into three separate dwellings.
They refurbish brought new technologies, better programs,
and practicality but keeping the quirky Georgian
style of the state. ON GOING PROJECT.
