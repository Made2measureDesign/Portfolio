The global private members’ club has taken space at 180
Strand for a multi-story development.
180 House will feature a ninth-floor rooftop pool and a
restaurant and bar with views over the Thames. There will
be two floors for member’s space, including an eight-floor
bar area for eating and drinking.
This brutalist building houses the offices of several creative
agencies. The design reflects the chic atmosphere with exposed
raw textures and patterns. This club will be a space
for people to share and connect.
