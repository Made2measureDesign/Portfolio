The Marylebone hotel consisted of the renovation of the hotelâ€™s
common areas. Divided into two phases; second floor (phase
one) and ground floor (phase two).
My work in this project consisted of the design and detailing of
the interiors. These included several pieces of furniture and fixed
joinery (3 bars, fixed meeting tables, mobile bars...). Also the
canopy and part of the facade.
