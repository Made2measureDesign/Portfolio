The Camden town brewery in Enfield consists
of two bars, a store, and offices featuring a secret
door. All inside the breweryâ€™s warehouse.

My duties were to develop the tender and
construction drawing packages.
Additionally, I collaborated in the construction
package of the Kentish Town Brewery.
