The Battersea Power Station is a large scale
development that consists of mixed residential,
commercial and offices spaces.
The scope of work lied within the 265 residences.
All the residences followed a simple
and elegant design maximizing the use of
the existing architecture. Leaving exposed
brickwork and steelwork materializing a
more raw and edgier cut.
My duties were to create models BIM models
of all 113 apartments types. And update
all drawings following the most recent
amendments due coordination.
