## About Me

###### Hi! I am Russo, a Russian born, Spanish raised and UK based designer, and self-taught Front-End developer. A creative individual with a great passion for architecture, design, and technology. 

For five years, I have worked with recognized architectural and interiors design studios in a wide range of projects. Parallelly, I have been feeding my passion for software development and graphic design by learning more every day working on personal projects and for private clients. Thanks to great open-source tools and material, I have developed several sites where I always push the boundaries of my knowledge.

My skills below: 

-Graphic design and brand identity
